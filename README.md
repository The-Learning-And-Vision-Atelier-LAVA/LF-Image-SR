#### With recent advances in camera manufacturing, light field (LF) imaging technology becomes increasingly popular and is commonly used in various applications such as mobile phones, biological microscope, VR/AR etc. Since both intensity and directions of light rays are recorded by LF cameras, the resolution of LF images can be enhanced by using these additional angular information. LF image super-resolution (SR), also known as LF spatial SR, aims at reconstructing high-resolution (HR) LF images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. In this repository, we present a collection of papers on LF image SR, together with their codes and repos. <br>
#### Note: This repository will be updated on a regular basis, so stay tuned~~ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## News: 
**We recommend our newly-released repository [BasicLFSR](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR), which is an open-source and easy-to-use toolbox for LF image SR. Both this repo and [BasicLFSR](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR) are developed to make the communities better get access to this area and re-impolement existing methods.

## Updates:
* **2021.12.09: New version is online, more recent methods such as DDAN, LF-IINet and LFT are included.**<br><br><br>
